# Schedule_Project

## Warning Notice !
This is my first Full-Stack Web Project I was working on. In react one of the main features is using reusable components with props pass and lifting state up if needed. Here I didnt follow this approach just because I was new to react. I am planning to rewrite everything in a proper way as well as finish thi project once I have more time. Currently, I have school, focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, have 2 jobs, play hockey and also engaged into the process of improving college curriculum for CS classes. During my full time and currently part time internship as Full-Stack Web Dev I have already used this feature of React, but unfortunately I am not allowed to share that code. Thank you!

## Description
I am in the process of developing an innovative academic planning platform designed to streamline the scheduling, enrollment, and tracking of academic progress for students, faculty, and support services. This platform seeks to transform educational administration by integrating personalized scheduling tools, comprehensive data analytics, and a collaborative interface. The goal is to enhance the efficiency of educational administration, improve student outcomes, and foster a more connected academic community. By addressing the complexities of academic planning and management, this platform aims to offer a smarter, more effective solution for managing academic life.

## Features
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Utilizes cutting-edge algorithms to optimize scheduling, ensuring maximum efficiency.
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Implements strategies to prevent scheduling conflicts before they occur.
- **Intuitive Reminders**: Enhances productivity through a robust reminder system tailored to user needs.
- **Versatile Viewing Options**: Provides various perspectives on schedules, aiding in better planning and organization.

## Tools & Technologies
This project was developed using a comprehensive stack of tools and technologies, designed to create a robust and scalable scheduling platform:

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript - for both frontend and backend development. The project is also exploring the potential use of TypeScript to enhance type safety and developer productivity.
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js - for building interactive user interfaces, and Next.js - for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js - a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js - for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Database**: MongoDB - a NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **ORM/ODM Library**: Mongoose - for data modeling and schema validation in MongoDB applications.
- **Client-side HTTP Request Library**: Axios - for making HTTP requests to the backend from the frontend, facilitating communication between client-side and server-side.
- **Authentication**:
  - **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
  - **bcrypt**: for securely hashing and storing passwords, enhancing the security of user authentication processes.
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion - for adding animations to React applications.
- **Package Manager**: NPM - for managing project dependencies.
- **Development Tools**:
  - **Nodemon**: for automatically restarting the node application when file changes are detected.

These tools were chosen for their performance, ease of use, and community support, making them ideal for developing modern web applications. The potential inclusion of TypeScript in the development stack is aimed at leveraging its static typing features to further enhance code quality and maintainability.
